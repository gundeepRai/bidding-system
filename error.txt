This happens because you haven't actually removed or disabled the /api/products/active route in your backend code. In your backend, the only defined product routes are:

POST /api/products/ (create product)
GET /api/products/created_By/:created_By (get products by user)
GET /api/products/:productId (get product by id)
There is no /api/products/active route defined in your current productRoutes.js.

Why does Postman still get a response? When you send a request to a non-existent route in Express, it will still return a response (usually a 404 or sometimes a default response if you have a catch-all handler).
But in your case, the GET /api/products/:productId route is catching /api/products/active and treating "active" as a productId parameter.

So, when you call /api/products/active, your backend runs the getProductById controller with productId = "active", which returns:

because there is no product with product_id: "active".

Summary:

/api/products/active is being matched by the GET /api/products/:productId route.
That's why you get a valid (but empty) response, not a 404.
How to fix this? If you want /api/products/active to return 404 unless you explicitly define it, you should reorder your routes in productRoutes.js:

Tip: Always put parameterized routes like /:id at the end, after all specific routes.





------------------------------------------ ERROR - 2 ---------------------------------------------------
while  at first on clicking user dashboard button, i was redirected to login.html page and nothing was happening on page. 
then in index.js file, i just changed theredirect login for dashboard button to redirect on auth.html if token is not there, I tested it worked. 
Even after logging was redirected to user_dashboard.





----------------------------- ERROR 3: create product failed on userdashboard -------------------------------
from frontend we were passing 4 fields while 5 were required to create product, and 5th one is product creator id.
We should not pass created_By from the frontend. It can be forged.
Instead, use the user_id that was injected into req.user by your protect middleware. Thatâ€™s what it's for.

there fore in backend  add line const created_By = req.user.user_id; before the line
    const productId = generateProductId(created_By, pname);
